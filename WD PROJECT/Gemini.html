  <h2>Gemini Yearly Horoscope</h2>
  <p>Saturn will require patience, attention to detail, and a disciplined approach both personally and professionally this year. Jupiter will provide you the chance to increase your network of friends as well as your professional and international connections.<br><br>

    You're going to put commitment, career, and health first this year. With Jupiter and Mercury's blessings, many dreams are expected to be realised in the second half.<br><br>
    
    The health of this year is expected to be mediocre. This year, your health will be significantly impacted by the way the planets are moving and how they influence your ideas.<br><br>
    
    In order to maintain your fitness and health, it is essential that you surround yourself with positive people and attempt to nurture good attitudes. A pregnant woman is also receiving guidance from Rahu and Ketu to pay attention to her health and avoid needless stress in order to give birth to a healthy child.<br><br>
    
    You are advised to stay away from heavy and greasy foods to regulate your anger and to improve your health because Mars movement might cause unneeded aggression. The student may experience slow growth and increased effort this year in order to get the desired outcome, as suggested by Saturn.<br><br>
    
    This year, you should abandon all long-term plans because Saturn's energies will slow down progress and demand perfection from you. To attain predicted accomplishment and achievement in your study plan, it would be best to build patience and tenacity.<br><br>
    
    Mars's first-quarter motion can inspire great ambition, but you need also learn to control your rage if you want things to run smoothly and in your favour. With determination and hard study, you can succeed in a competitive exam and receive recognition.<br><br>
    
    Rahu can encourage people to take writing and digital marketing-related courses. You should expect success this year if you're a journalism or science student.<br><br>
    
    The Mars movement may cause some of you to lose confidence. Overall, this year is expected to provide a fresh career platform where you can provide your best effort in terms of work and new professional endeavours.<br><br>
    
    Those of you who are now employed will receive additional responsibilities, which may increase workload and pressure, but will also serve as a steppingstone for your success this year. It is advised for those of you who are currently employed to refrain from having combative conversations with top government officials.<br><br>
    
    A career in research can be successful when Mars and the Sun are in harmony. Those of you who are in the wholesale industry can anticipate success this year.<br><br>
    
    Additionally, Ketu and Mercury encourage beginning a career in medicine. This year, Mars and the Sun will assist you in laying a solid basis for beginning your athletic career.<br><br>
    
    Mars may make an unexpected partnership proposal, but Ketu's influence on your romantic relationship may cause a delay or unwelcome obstacle. Don't ignore your intuition since it will lead you in the proper route when it comes to a romantic relationship.<br><br>
    
    This year, there may be a covert link between the Sun and Mercury. Those of you who are secretly dating should exercise caution since difficulties may arise when siblings and parents interact.<br><br>
    
    Those who desire to get married this year will benefit from this year's favourable circumstances. Jupiter's movement may lead to international relocation after a second-quarter marriage.<br><br>
    
    Some of you might also receive a romantic or marriage proposal from your own country. Marriage and a marriage proposal from long-time friends are both brought about by the Sun and Mercury movements.<br><br>
    
    This year's beginning can be challenging for relationships with in-laws. Your marital life may be impacted by an unexpected quarrel or conflict in thoughts, according to the Sun and Mercury.<br><br>
    
    Avoiding conflict can help Jupiter make things better with your patience and upbeat attitude. This year, Saturn may cause some delays in projects with real estate, so you must exercise patience.<br><br>
    
    Jupiter and Saturn can be of assistance to those of you who have been waiting for a while regarding property matters this year, but these two planets demand patience when going through the legal procedure. Third-quarter Jupiter movement may indicate pilgrimages or expenses associated with international travel.</p>
